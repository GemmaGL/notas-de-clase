Guidelines on how to submit the labs
EXTRA
To submit the lab:
Fork the lab

Clone the lab to your computer (navigate to the folder where you keep all your labs and paste the command that will most likely be in this format: https://github.com/your-username/title-of-the-lab.git)

Run git remote -v => to make sure you cloned from your GitHub not the Ironhack labs (this will happen if you forgot to fork, so this is a check point)

git status => here you can check on which files you made changes

After each iteration, commit the change and do this at the very end. The steps are:
5.1 git add .
5.2 git commit -m"very descriptive message in present tense goes here"
5.3 git push origin master

Now if you go to your GitHub you will see all the changes you made and just pushed. Now make PULL REQUEST so everyone in the team can see what you did and the TA can check your code. Go on “PULL REQUESTS” and click on “NEW PULL REQUEST”.

When submitting use this format:
a) individual assessment: [FTMIA062019] yourName / [PTMIA062019] yourName
b) pair-programming assessment: [FTMIA062019] yourName-yourPartnersName / [PTMIA062019] yourName-yourPartnersName
